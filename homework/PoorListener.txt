The degree of most peopleâ€™s listening skills vary and therefore it's hard to measure that if they are poor listener or not. 

In my personal opinion most people are poor listeners. Even when people are thinking they are listening carefully. People usually grasp only a certain percentage of what they hear, and out of that they retain even less. Most of those who are listening to a conversation are just waiting to start talking. 

Most of the people assume what the other person is trying to say just by listening to first few words, hence people will not have gained any insight/new information from the conversation. They jump to conclusion and judge a speaker without hearing out the message. People mostly judge others by their appearances and there style/manner of speaking rather than listening to what they have to say.

Mostly people are mentally and physically distracted while listening. Many times people let there thoughts wander rather than concentrating on what is being said. On the other hand, if they try to listen too hard and try to remember each and every word of a speaker, they lose the main message by concentrating on the details.

Improving listening skills can be helpful in every part of life. Listening is a key to effective working relationship between employees and management and staff. It would help managers if they listen carefully to what people are saying. Very often, good ideas and solutions can come from your subordinates, if you listen to them.
