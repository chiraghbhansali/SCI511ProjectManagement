Q1.How should Jennifer go about making her decision?

For  any form of decision making, Jennifer should have a complete in depth understanding of the issues currently presented by each of her managers. 

First, she needs to set up a dedicated in person session with each of them trying to understand the bottlenecks and gauge the gravity of impact on the company in terms of cost, quality and efficiency. A good way to go about with these discussions would be to have an unbiased opinion on any concept or idea and at the same time not get influenced by the thoughts of senior members or pressurized with personalized gestures / comments. For instance, Joe mentioned that if Jennifer’s father were in her position, he would have done it a certain way.  

The second step would be to understand and evaluate their proposal as to how they plan to bring in efficiency or reduce cost or increase sales/productivity.  


Q2.What kind of additional data or information should she collect?

A full proof way of evaluating the current situation is with facts and figures. She should conduct a complete assessment of the current resources and infrastructure by demanding the inputs from the respective managers on following grounds. 
1. Julie  (Venture on the new competitive drug launch)

Provide facts around the existing situation along the following grounds –

·        The current approach plan and project timelines
·        Any mid-milestones accomplishments
·        Understand/Gauge the current scientist expertise in the subject area
Provide facts around the proposed idea along the following grounds –
·        Required expertise for the new scientist
·        How will this resource carve out the project towards the final product
 
2. Tyler (Plans to change the equipment layout)
Provide facts around the existing situation along the following grounds –
·        Call out the inefficiencies in terms of cost or time
·        Call out the actual implementations or installations which led to piled up inefficiencies in the plant layout (to avoid the same mistake in future)
Provide facts around the proposed idea along the following grounds –
·        Number of member teams to be used and with what specific expertise
·        The plan to utilize these members for the correction of the plant layout
·        Since the existing employees would be used for this activity, would it impact the overall production work
·        What would be Tylers’ role and responsibility in this initiative
 
3. Jeff (Improve operations by upgrading the infrastructure)
Provide facts around the existing situation along the following grounds – 
·        Call out the inefficiencies in terms of cost or time or loss of work
·        Call out manual dependencies leading to other soft inefficiencies
 
Provide facts around the proposed situation along the following grounds –
·        # of new system required to handle the existing operations
·        Evaluate if the proposed infrastructure is scalable to handle the operational volume in future thus not to ending up re-investing in a recurring manner
·        How will the new systems help reduce the dependency on employees to move towards a more system driven operations
·        How does this eventually prove to be cost beneficial and when will the company start incurring the profits
 
4. Joe (Improve sales through addition of Sales Representatives)
Provide facts around the existing situation along the following grounds –
·        Existing Sales trend by month and geographical locations
·        Existing # of Sales Reps distributed in these locations
 
Provide facts around the proposed situation along the following grounds –
·        Which specific areas or timeframes would be focused for increased marketing
·        How many Sales Reps would be required and in which locations
·        What would be the reason for the increased focus on those locations
·        Understand the ROI against the proposal
