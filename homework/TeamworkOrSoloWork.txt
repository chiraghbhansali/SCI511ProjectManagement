Do you prefer to work alone or in a group? Why?
For most of the project work I prefer to work as a group. I believe I am a good team player. I belive in cooperation and teamwork. A lot of work, objective can be achieved when everyone is pulling together. I would like have multiple brains working towards same objective as the end product will have more holistic solution, which might not be possible if a single individual worked on it. As a team we can have multiple brainstorming sessions, which can help see other dimensions to the same problem.  The healthy debates and respectful disagreements while working as a team are the strongest catalysts that helped me excel in each and every task I performed. 
I feel more motivated working in a group. Working as a group helped me learn from other individuals. There thought process, different skills, experiences, intellects add valuable skills to my own experience. As a group I can get positive feedback from other individuals on the decisions I make. Similarly I can provide immediate feedback which make the decision more reliable. I feel that everyone has something different to contribute to an effort because we all come from such diverse backgrounds.
But working as a group has its fair share of drawbacks. Sometimes I ended up doing all the work alone. Other's knew I am hard working and can complete the task. So they pile on and the whole thing ended up being credited as a teamwork even though single individual worked on it. But I believe whenever I got stuck in such situations they are the individuals who were wrong, not the teamwork. I simply had to upgrade the circle.
