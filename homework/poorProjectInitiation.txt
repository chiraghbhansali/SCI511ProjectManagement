I have worked on a project where i experienced poor project initiation.

The project was to upgrade infrastructure system of a product which will provide better performance and new features to the product end user.


Below were the mistakes which took place.

1) No kick-off meeting

2) Project objective was not clear with the project team and the stakeholders

3) No involvement of team members who were actually going to work on the project

4) Team members were not aware of there individual roles and responsibilities

5) Unrealistic schedule

6) Delay from third party vendor on timely deliverables of resources

7) No communication between the dependent teams

8) Activities were not identified.

9) No reporting period for comparing actual progress with planned progress

In order to resolve these mistakes management did following things

1) Proper project objective was defined

2) Key team members were involved

3) Activities identified and prioritized

4) Responsibilities assigned

5) Proper communication among the teams involved established

6) Regular meetings were setup to monitor the progress
